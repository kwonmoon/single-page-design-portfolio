## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Javascript

### What I learned

It was a great pleasure to learn how to play with images and viewports using pure javascript. I didn't want to use any libraries since my goal is to learn how to do it by myself. I spent a lot of time to deal with images in the "My Work" section and it gave me a lot of satisfaction seeing the improvements step by step. To be honest with you, I got a lot of help from chatGPT. I didn't ask chatGPT to do the programming job for me since eventually I had to figure out to put pieces together to make it work the way I wanted. I googled a lot but my solution is a lot simpler and very easy to understand.


### Continued development

I will be devote more effort in javascript since it gave me a feeling of total control.
